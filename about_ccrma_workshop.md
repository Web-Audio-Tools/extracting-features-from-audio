## Testimonials<a href="#Testimonials" class="anchor-link">¶</a>

_"You guys put together a really fantastic workshop."_

_"I really enjoyed the workshop. It was very well executed and exceeded my expectations in the scope of material covered."_

_"Well planned and thoughtful."_

_"My own participation in this course started me down a path that I couldn't have foreseen and landed me several music tech jobs with startups and now an established company. Highly recommend this workshop!"_

_"It was a fun week. I learned a lot, and met some very cool people. That week helped shape where I am now in a couple of ways."_

_"I'd take this course again, if my schedule permits. It's a very cool introduction to Information Retrieval and Machine Learning through Music, for sure. Definitely recommended!"_

_"This was a great introduction to the field of MIR which I am now applying to human studies of the cognitive neuroscience of music."_

_"This is a fantastic workshop. I'd also love to take it again when I find the time."_

## About the Workshop<a href="#About-the-Workshop" class="anchor-link">¶</a>

The Stanford CCRMA Workshop on Music Information Retrieval (MIR) teaches the underlying ideas, approaches, technologies, and practical design of intelligent audio systems using MIR algorithms. It lasts five full days, Monday through Friday. It was founded by [Jay LeBoeuf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayleboeuf) (Real Industry, CCRMA consulting professor) in 2008.

The workshop is intended for students, researchers, musicians, and engineers who want to learn more about music information retrieval (MIR). We demonstrate technologies enabled by signal processing and machine learning such as feature extraction, chord estimations, audio similarity clustering, search and retrieval, music synchronization, signal decomposition, rhythm and tempo, and design and evaluation of machine learning systems. Our goal is to introduce these interdisciplinary technologies and complex algorithms in an approachable way.

Knowledge of basic digital audio principles is recommended. Some experience with any programming language -- whether Python, Matlab, C, C++, Java, Javascript, or other -- is desired.

The workshop consists of lectures, demonstrations, discussions, and interactive lab sessions. Labs allow students to design intelligent audio systems leveraging existing MIR toolboxes, programming environments, and applications.
